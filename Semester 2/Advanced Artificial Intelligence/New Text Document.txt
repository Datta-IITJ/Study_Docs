In the field of Artificial Intelligence, a Sequential Decision Problem refers to a decision-making process in which an agent takes actions in a sequence of states over time, with the goal of maximizing a reward function. The agent must consider the uncertainty in the environment, as the outcome of an action may not be deterministic.

To specify a Sequential Decision Problem, we use a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is defined by three components: the initial state, the transition model, and the reward function. The transition model describes the probability of moving from one state to another, given an action, and the reward function defines the reward received by the agent for being in a particular state.

To solve the problem, we need to find an optimal policy, which is a sequence of actions that the agent should take in each state to maximize the expected reward. The quality of a policy is measured by the expected utility of the possible environment histories generated by that policy.

In MDPs, the balance between risk and reward is important, and it is often necessary to balance the cost of taking actions against the potential reward of reaching the goal state. This balancing act is not present in deterministic search problems and is a defining characteristic of MDPs.

MDPs have been extensively studied in various fields, including AI, operations research, economics, and control theory, as they are useful in modeling many real-world decision-making problems.

A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making problems where the outcomes depend on a sequence of actions taken over time, and where the outcomes are affected by random events or uncertain factors. In an MDP, the decision-maker (or agent) interacts with an environment that is characterized by a set of states, a set of possible actions, and a set of probabilities that describe the outcomes of taking each action in each state.

The quality of a policy in an MDP is measured by the expected utility of the possible environment histories generated by that policy. An optimal policy is a policy that yields the highest expected utility. The agent decides what action to take based on the current state and the optimal policy, which is a description of a simple reflex agent.

The balancing of risk and reward is a characteristic of MDPs that does not arise in deterministic search problems, and it is a characteristic of many real-world decision problems. MDPs have been studied in several fields, including AI, operations research, economics, and control theory. Many algorithms have been proposed for calculating optimal policies.
Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used in decision-making problems that involve a sequence of events over time. It is often used in reinforcement learning, which is a branch of machine learning concerned with training agents to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal.

In an MDP, the decision-maker or agent interacts with an environment in discrete time-steps. At each time-step, the agent observes the current state of the environment and selects an action to perform. The environment then transitions to a new state based on the action taken by the agent and the probability distribution of possible outcomes. Each state has a reward associated with it, and the agent's goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

The key assumption of MDP is that the probability distribution of the next state and reward depends only on the current state and action taken by the agent. This property is known as the Markov property and allows for the use of dynamic programming algorithms to solve MDPs.

Solving an MDP involves finding a policy, which is a mapping from each state to an action. The optimal policy is one that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time. Value iteration and policy iteration are two commonly used algorithms for solving MDPs.
